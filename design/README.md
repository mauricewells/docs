# Design

## **Biomimicry**

**ixo protocol networks** are designed to mimic how the human immune system operates. These networks form an Internet of Impact which is conceptually a global digital immune system for humanity.

The purpose of this internet is to **sense and respond** to sustainability threats or opportunities. 

Sensing applications include:

* IoT
* 
This decentralised architecture must enable local coordination with rapid information feedback loops. It must be possible to rapidly amplify cyber-physical mechanisms that can support social, environmental and economic interventions to scale effectively and safely.

## Complex adaptive dynamical systems

Humans in the loop

Economy in the loop

Environment in the loop
