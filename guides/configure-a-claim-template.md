# Configure a Claim Template

The simplest way to start configuring a claim template is to use a pre-existing template as the basis. Templates can be found in the Templates Explorer section of the ixo-webclient.

To create a new Claim Template from scratch, you can ask the ixo-assistant to guide you through the process by asking something like "I want to create a new Service Claim template". This will open up the relevant page in the ixo-webclient where you can complete the claim template setup using the configuration form. 

Every claim template has three sections, with associated objects:

* Form fields, which includes the following types of cards:
  * Short text
  * Long Text
  * Multiple-choice
  * Radio button
  * Photo capture  / image upload
  * Picture selector
  * Sliding scale
  * Video capture / file upload
  * Sound recording / file upload
  * Document scan / file upload
  * QR code scan
  * Email with validation
  * Mobile phone with validation
  * Identity and credential with validation
  * Profile photo for identity verification
* Settings, which includes metadata about the claim template:
  * Creator
  * Version
  * 
* Advanced Settings



Verifiable Claims are defined as a JSON Schema using JSON-LD.
