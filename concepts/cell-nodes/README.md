# Cell Nodes

## Cells and Cell Nodes

**A Cell** is a powerful cooperation mechanism which enables people to self-organise and self-govern to achieve a common mission.    

**Cell nodes** provide the digital infrastructure for this decentralised, autonomous, locally responsive, adaptable, highly networked, intelligent and purpose-driven cellular form of organisation.

[Cellular organisational structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_organizational_structure) are common in nature \(think about how human immune cells sense and respond to infections\). Now we can power-up Cells through hyper-connected intelligence networks and using a new generation of digital tools, with high-definition data and programmable capital.

![People form a Cell to pursue a shared mission](../../.gitbook/assets/cell-node-group3.svg)

Cell nodes enable data to be communicated quickly and securely through a [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust). All participants in a cell have access to the same information and share intelligence both within their own cell node and with other organisations, through Internet of Impact networks .

The digital artefacts created by a cell \(such as Project Documents\) are stored in the node as stateful records which are referenced in a distributed ledger. Public metadata are stored using the [Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io) \(IPFS\). This allows cell nodes to retain a form of memory that can be [stigmergically](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Stigmergy) shared and rapidly amplified when cells need to be replicated or re-activated.

## Purpose of a Cell

The purpose of a Cell defines how this will operate in terms of membership, size, location, lifespan, scope of projects it undertakes and other types of organisational characteristics. A Cell Node is configured to fit the purpose of a cell. 

The founder/s of a cell define its purpose - usually with an explicit mission statement. **Examples of cell types and their primary purpose:**

| Cell Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| Citizen Cell | Mobilise citizen action towards a common cause. |
| Hackathon Cell | Hack a prototype solution for a specific challenge. |
| Procurement Cell | Negotiate the supply of goods/services in an accountable and transparent way. |
| Investment Cell | Form and allocate capital for debt and/or equity investments. |
| Startup accelerator Cell | Support ventures to find product-market fit and deploy their value propostions. |
| Taskforce Cell | Tackle a specific task with a defined mandate and deliverable. |
| R&D Cell | Research and develop novel solutions though an experimental process. |
| Cooperative Cell | Facilitate broad economic stake-holding in the supply and/or demand of goods and services. |
| Mutual Credit Cell | Form and allocate capital through a peer-to-peer marketplace. |

## The Cell mission

Each cell defines its mission explicitly in terms of credible commitments that can be collectively monitored. Cell commitments are accountable, measurable and verifiable. For instance a Procurement Cell can define its mission as: _"Source and distribute 1,000 Ventilators to provide care for people infected with the Covid-19 virus."_

## Cell projects

A Cell pursues its mission by implementing one or more projects. The scope of each project is defined in an immutable Project Document. Project information and all the data collected by every project that the Cell implements gets stored in the Cell Node.

The performance of each project is tracked through claims which are submitted by the Agents who are authorised to work on the project. Claims are independenly evaluated and verified \(for instance, by Proofing Oracles\).

Find out more about Projects and Claims Verification.

## Cell agents

Participants in a cell are referred to as Agents. Agents include identified individuals, organisations, software agents and devices.

Agent roles can be broadly categorised as:

* Implementing agents
* Evaluation agents
* Investment agents

Each agent is identified by a Self-sovereign digital identifier, with associated verifiable credentials. Credentials are issued by known entities within a web of trust. Every message or transaction an agent sends is signed with their Identity. This ensures a high level of agent accountability, trust and compliance.

Agents are given rights for perform specific roles. They issue verifiable claims which attest to the contributions they make towards the mission of the cell. This makes agents fully accountable. The Cell Node is designed to store agent identifiers and credentials in a way that ensures privacy and protects their personal information.

Cells may incentivise agents with tokenised rewards, which are tracked by the Cell Node. Agents can also be economically penalised for not operating within the rules of the cell.

Find out more about Agents.

## Cell sovereignty

Cells are independent, censorship-resistant sovereign entities within the Internet of Impact.

Each cell operates its own private computational and data storage node. Cell Node software and data can be self-hosted or hosted as a service.

The founder of a cell holds the keys to the Cell Node and retains full external access control over the cell's data.

The cell founder decides which agents and services are permissioned to connect with the cell and is able to manage or revoke these permissions. Access and authentication is autonomously managed by the Cell Node, without relying on centralised authentication services. This makes Cell Nodes censorship-resistant.

## The Cell Founder

The role of a cell founder is to instantiate the cell, manage the keys of the cell and ensure that the call operates effectively.

The founder of a cell can be:

* One or more identified individuals;
* One or more identified organisations;
* A combination of individuals and/or organisations operating through a decentralised autonomous organisation \(DAO\).

Cells are principally organisations of people with digital super-powers. To be successful, participants in a cell need to be well-governed, incentivised and empowered. This requires leadership, cooperation and accountability.

## Cell governance

Once a cell has been formed, it may be governed by the founder/s or by all the participants in the cell. The Cell Founder configures a governance mechanism when the Cell Node is instantiated.

Decisions and actions may be made by the Cell Founder, or by cell agents. The Cell Node provides governance tools for stakeholders to make proposals, vote and pass executable resolutions. These tools are available as Cell Node plug-ins, such as [DAOStack](http://daostack.io) Holographic consensus.

## **Cell incentives**

Cells exist within an economy that broadly had three types of common enterprises. Each common has its own incentive mechanisms:

* The  [Entrepreneurial Common](http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/index.php?title=Entrepreneurial_Common&action=edit&redlink=1) interface the cell with external ecosystems and markets.  This is responsible for the financial and monetary policy. It will determine the costs of membership, how the cell is owned and how to distribute capital. Incentives may be created by issuing and distributing shares or tokens that embody rights to ownership, economic participation and use of the cell's capital resources. 
* The Production Common produces goods and services though the collaborative efforts and work of members in the cell. As incentives, contributors may be paid for their work, or receive shares for the value they have created.
* The For-Benefit Common governs the cell mission, impact goals, operating policies, membership, consensus rules, rights and incentive mechanisms. An incentive for participating in the For-benefit common of a cell will typically include voting rights, which may also be modified by reputation.

## Cell resources

There are many possible ways of resourcing the operations of a cell from commerical, philanthropic or peer-to-peer sources.

The Cell Node may also use decentralised financing tools such as Alpha Bonds to raise capital.

## How to set up of a Cell Node

The easiest way to start is with a template. Browse [ixo.world templates](https://app.ixo.world/templates) to find one that fits close enough to the purpose and other characteristics of the cell you want to form. The ixo guide explains this further. 

If you can't find a template that suits your specific needs, start a new cell template with guidance from the ixo-assistant chatbot.

## The costs of operating a Cell Node

Registering a Cell Node with a Decentralised Identifier and Cell Document on the Sustainability Hub incurs a negligible transaction fee \(gas\) for writing these records to the blockchain.

Hosting costs for a Cell Node depends on the choice of hosting service, or self-hosted option. 

Cells can choose to employ services and acquire applications from a growing network marketplace, where the costs are determined by providers.
