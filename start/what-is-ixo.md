# What is ixo?

#### ixo is an open-source project building the **Internet of Impact with** high-definition data protocols and Web 3.0 technology innovations.

**ixo Protocol networks** are blockchain-based webs of trust through which to deliver, verify and invest in impacts. This is foundational digital infrastructure for the impact economy.

**Users create verifiable claims** to capture a temper-proof digital record of the state of the world \(about any imaginable subject\). Claims are evaluated by independent trusted verification services \(which ixo calls **Proofing Oracles**\).

**Verified claims** with their crypto-economic proofs and data assets are tokenised. For instance a Carbon Emission Reduction claim can produce a verified, information-rich Carbon Credit token. 

**Tokenised Impact** makes the results of development processes more precisely measurable and valuable. Tokens can be traded and used in decentralised development finance mechanisms, such as Alpha Bonds.   

#### **ixo is a technology for all people**.
